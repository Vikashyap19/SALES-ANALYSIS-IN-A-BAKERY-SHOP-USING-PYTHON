Project Description: Sales Analysis in a Bakery Shop: A Data Mining Approach

This project explores the sales data from a French bakery to uncover meaningful insights using data mining techniques. By analyzing the dataset, which includes details such as date, time, product, quantity, and price, the project aims to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior.

The study focuses on the following aspects:

Data Preprocessing:

Ensuring data quality by addressing potential issues like missing or mistyped values.
Applying one-hot encoding for transaction analysis.
Methodology:

The Apriori algorithm is utilized to identify frequent itemsets with a support threshold of 1%.
Association rules are derived to understand relationships between items, helping to reveal cross-selling opportunities and customer buying habits.
Findings:

Products like "Baguette" and "Banette" are the most frequently sold items.
Association rules suggest strong correlations, such as customers purchasing "BOULE 200G" often buying "COUPE."
Applications:

Insights can guide inventory management, promotional strategies, and product placements.
Long-term analysis may reveal seasonal trends, enabling targeted marketing.
This analysis highlights the potential of data mining for strategic decision-making in retail, demonstrating how understanding customer preferences can lead to improved business outcomes.
